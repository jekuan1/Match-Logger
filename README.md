# Match-Logger
Match logger my friends and I used (created by me) to track our pool table games

I built this website as my friends and I were tracking our pool table matches on a whiteboard with tallies.
Although it kept the competition up it wasn't a very good long term solution.
I thought of the idea of creating a locally hosted website and then created this over the summer. I host it using gunicorn + NGINX on my mac.

The system using a ELO rating system to reward players who are worse for beating better players. I learned a lot about python, flask, and databases.
